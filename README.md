# MachStat_Autumn_2023_project

This repository contains the files for the Machine Learning and Statistics assessment for Autumn 2023.

The project consists of two Jupyter notebooks, one using SciPy.stats to perform linear regression on the red wine quality dataset, the other using it to perform a paired sample t-test on car crash fatality statistics from a two-year period in the US. The CSV files for the datasets are included in the repository. The notebook cells have been executed before pushing to Github, so the user is not required to run the commands.
